            <p>This project was created in my Human-Computer Interaction course.
            The focus was to create any website using a resource available online with purpose of
            solving a problem or creating a service. <br> My group's idea was to create
            a website that graphic designers can use to display their art (portfolio) and
            connect with other graphic designers on the website.
             </p>
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>This project challenged my leadership and communication skills. All group members came 
            from different backgrounds and had conflicting schedules to work with. With great communication 
            and initiative from all parties, we were able to complete the project and meet our design expectations.
