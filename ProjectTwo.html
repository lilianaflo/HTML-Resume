        <p>This is the final project I completed for my Technical Writing course. <br>
            Throughout the semester, we created important employment documents for a real job posting we found on the internet.<br>
             The focus was to give us an opportunity to practice making employment documents
             and strengthening our technical writing skills. I was required to focus on different factors such as <br>
             accessability and presentation.
        </p>

        <h3>Skills I Learned</h3>
        <p>With this project, I learned why it is important to incorporate contrast and balance <br>
        in all projects and documents I create. Further, I learned how to make a resume and which content employers look for.
